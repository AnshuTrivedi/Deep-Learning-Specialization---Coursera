   2. Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.
   3. AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.
   4. Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.\

1.  Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
2.  Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
3.  It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset.
4.  Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).\
ans:1,2,4
#### Question 4: When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
1. True
2. False\
ans: 2

#### Question 6:Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?
 1.True <br/>
 2.False\
 ans: 2
####  Question 7: A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
1.True\
2.False\
ans: 2
####  Question 8: Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)
1.It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.\
2.It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\
3.It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).\
4.RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....\
ans: 1,3
### Question 9:In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?
<img src="https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/JP--G3ooEeeJIwrF5BVsIg_b60d752c05bec0881d8ca08cfc2646d2_Screen-Shot-2017-08-05-at-2.30.09-PM.png?expiry=1567555200000&hmac=wdLsX4wrhIDUXokw2U0NZZH-ljbzOeoyvJ9nhJ4V1eM">

1.x-axis is the amount of data
  y-axis is the size of the model you train.

2.x-axis is the performance of the algorithm
  y-axis (vertical axis) is the amount of data.

3.x-axis is the input to the algorithm
  y-axis is outputs.

4.x-axis is the amount of data
 y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.\
